This is a battery cell management toolbox in Python.  It is derived from Dr. Gregory Plett's BMS tools (written in MATLAB), which are available at mocha-java.uccs.edu/BMS1/.

This archive includes files necessary for ESC cell modeling, SOC estimate and cell capacity estimate.  An example of P14 cell is also included.

-P14_OCV: Contains P14 cell test data that can be used to find relationships between SOC and OCV.
-P14_DYN: Contains P14 cell test data that can be used to find ESC model parameters.
-ESC_modeling.ipynb: Defines data structure and functions of ESC model.
-ESC_modeling_ProcessOCV.ipynb: Find relationships between SOC and OCV.
-ESC_modeling_ProcessDynamic.ipynb: Find ESC model parameters.
-P14_model.pickle: Stores P14 ESC model.
-ESC_Sim_Demo.ipynb: Demonstrates cell simulation by ESC model.
-SOC_Est_SPKF.ipynb: Defines data structure and function for SOC estimate using SPKF.
-SOC_Est_Demo.ipynb: Demonstrates SOC estimate algorithm.
-Q_Est_AWTLS.ipynb: Defines data structure and function for cell capacity estimate using AWTLS.
-Q_Est_Demo.ipynb: Demonstrates cell capacity estimate algorithm.

See the comments in each file for more information.
